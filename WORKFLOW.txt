w21812b development of a new program
====================================

Option No. 1 (Arduino IDE)
--------------------------

0. Register this library with the standard means to Arduino IDE.

1. In Arduino IDE, open a new project.
   As a first command, include the library writing
   
     #include <WS2812b.h>
    
   Save file with a filename of the form PROJECT'S_IRECTORY_NAME.ino

2. Write the rest your program and test it, compiling and / or uploading it regularily.
   (Make shure your programmer's port settings are correct for uploading.)

Option No. 2 (using a bash-shell on a computer running Linux)
-------------------------------------------------------------

0. An appropriate Makefile is added in Makefile_Template. Edit it to set up your favorite editor.

1. Copy this Makefile to the directory in which you want to write the new program.

2. Run the following command:
   
     echo -e "#include <WS2812b.h>\nvoid setup() {\n}\nvoid loop() {\n}\n" > $(basename $(pwd)).ino
     
3. Type "make make" and set up your type of board.

   (If using a hardware programmer, also set this up. If using an arduino board directly, without a hardware
   programmer, all port settings will be made automagically.)

4. Type "make edit" and start editing your program.

5. Test your program by typing "make" (compilation only) or "make prog" (compilation and transfering to chip).

Repeat steps 4. and 5. until finished.
